## What is a Flower?
A flower in the botanical sense is is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants and contains a vegetative part (the perianth - sepal and petals) and a reproductive part (carpel and stamens).

When we look at a flower from a design perspective it's a structure containing a stem, petals and a center. It grows at a certain point (the stem's starting point) and has a defined height (stem length) as well as center with a defined diameter and a number of petals originating from the center, with a certain shape.
